# Contio: Meeting scheduling

## This is the frontend of this app. For backend, visit [contio_backend](https://github.com/jadonus/contio_backend)

This is a pretty simple app: the meeting head creates the time, and sends an app generated link to the people in the meeting. They then can press on the times they are availible, and an email will be sent back to the original creator with responses. Made with Sveltekit.

>In Case you are Wondering, Contio means 'meeting' or 'assembly' in Latin.
